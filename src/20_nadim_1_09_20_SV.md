## Cross coverage
* Cross Coverage is specified between the cover points or variables
* Expressions cannot be used directly in a cross; a coverage point must be explicitly defined first
## Types of constraints

- Constraint Block, External Constraint Blocks and Constraint Inheritance
- Inside Operator
- Weighted Distribution
- Implication Operator and if-else
- Iterative in Constraint Blocks (foreach constraints)
- Disable Constraint
- Static Constraints
- In line Constraints
- Functions in Constraints
- Soft Constraints
- Unique Constraints
- Bidirectional Constraints
- Solve-Before

### [Interface: modport & clockingblock](http://www.verilab.com/files/paper51_taming_tb_timing_FINAL_fixes.pdf)
#### Clocking Block
A clocking block must be part of a module or interface.

Nomenclature|Use
:-:|:-:
clocking event   : provides a synchronization reference for DUT and testbench | this part is what enables us to avert race conditions
clocking signals : to be sampled and driven by the testbench | can be any type: <br> nets and variables
clocking skew    : the timing, relative to the clock event, that the testbench uses to drive and sample those signals | inputs must not have #0 delay, outputs can
clockvar: cb.signal; not a signal | should only be used with <br> nb assignment `<=`

Uses:
- Cycle oriented
- Decoupling Testbench from Signal Details
  - `@(posedge clk)` becomes `@cb`
- Assuring Race-free Reading of Input Clockvars
  - `cb.clockvar` better accessed `@cb` rather than ~~`@(posedge clk)`~~
- Features:-
  - Inactive-Edge Skew Ex: `output negedge some_signal`
  - `default clocking any_name@(posedge sysclk); endclocking`

#### ModPorts
- groups and specifies the port directions to the wires/signals declared within the interface
- declared inside the interface with the keyword modport.
- can contain clocking block
- can be made virtual

`@ev` | `wait(ev.triggered)`
:-:|:-:
@ statement should be executed before the trigger|wait can be executed before or after the trigger <br> (but in same time slot)
